    "1. Inheritance is a fundamental concept that allows a new class to inherit the characteristics of an parent class. The parent class is often referred as \"base class,\" or \"superclass,\" and the new class is known as the \"derived class\" \"child class\" or \"subclass\".\n",

    "Inheritance is used for Code Reusability, flexible and organization by allowing classes to inherit attributes and methods from other classes\n",
    "\n",
    "Code Reusability: Inheritance promotes code reuse by allowing a class to inherit the features of an existing class. This reduces redundancy and makes the code more modular.\n",
    "\n",
    "Polymorphism: Inheritance facilitates polymorphism, where objects of the derived class can be treated as objects of the base class. This allows for more flexibility in designing and using classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hierarchy and Organization: Inheritance allows for the creation of class hierarchies, where more specialized classes can be organized under more general classes. This helps in structuring and organizing code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ease of Maintenance: Changes made to the base class automatically reflect in the derived classes. This makes it easier to maintain and update code, as modifications in one place can affect multiple classes."

    "\n",
    "Simplicity: Single inheritance is conceptually simpler and easier to understand. The hierarchy is straightforward, making the code more readable.\n",

    "Reduced Complexity: With a single parent class, there is less ambiguity and fewer potential conflicts in method and attribute resolution.\n",

    "\n",
    "Code Reusability: Multiple inheritance allows a class to reuse code from multiple sources, leading to better code organization and reuse.\n",

    "Flexibility: It provides flexibility in designing classes, as a new class can combine features from different classes, promoting a modular and extensible design.\n",
